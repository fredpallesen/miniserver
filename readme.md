# Minimal http server using node js

A node js server returning one html file only.

Added Januar 14 2018 by Fred Pallesen

## Requirements

Node JS must be installed
> choco install nodejs
https://chocolatey.org

## Setup

The server will run on port 80.
You may want to change this line:
> const port = 80;

## Startup

> node server

The server will print a message
that it is running, go try it out 
from your browser:
> http://localhost/

Add a :port if you changed it from the default (80))

## Shutdown

If you are running powershell (within Visual Studio Code)
or Git Bash: use Ctrl-C, if not: close your cmd window.
